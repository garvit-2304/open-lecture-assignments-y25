# open-lecture-assignments-y25

This is the official repository to submit the lecture assignments.

## Submission Guidelines -

* You have to make a directory of your name and add the assignment wise folders in it according to the following format-

Your_Name/  
│── assignment_1/  
│   ├── [Files for Assignment 1]  
│── assignment_2/  
│   ├── [Files for Assignment 2]  
│── assignment_3/  
│   ├── [Files for Assignment 3]

* Make separate folder for each question in the assignment, so it becomes easy to review for us.

## How to submit?

1. Fork this repository.
2. Complete the assignment in your respective folder.
3. Create a pull request to submit your work.

## Important Notes- 

* We will continuously monitor your progress through Git commits.
* Do not submit all assignments at once—your work should be added incrementally over time.
* We encourage you to engage deeply with the assignments. If you have any questions or need clarification, feel free to reach out.
